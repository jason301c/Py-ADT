# Py-ADT
## Motivations
I am starting this project to learn more regarding various types of ADTs and their applications.
## Scope
This project I'll try to write templates for all common ADTs as well as their common implementations. Furthermore, I'd like to expand to use cases of various different data structures.
Here are the ADT's that are on my mind:
*Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap, Graph, Tree, Stack, Queue, Priority queue, Double-ended queue, Double-ended priority queue*

Common implementations of these ADTs will also be on my to-do list.
